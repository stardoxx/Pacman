# Pacman
Pac-Man is a classic arcade game developed by Namco and released in 1980.
The objective of the game is to control the titular character, Pac-Man, through a maze and eat all the dots while avoiding four ghosts.
Pac-Man can also eat power pellets, which allow him to turn the tables and chase and eat the ghosts for a short period of time.
If Pac-Man comes into contact with a ghost while not powered up, he loses a life.
The game has 256 levels, but due to a bug in level 256, it is impossible to beat.
In addition to the main gameplay, there are also fruit that appear for bonus points, as well as bonus levels that can be accessed by eating all the dots on a level.
The game has been adapted for numerous platforms and has been released in various forms and sequels


About Deep Q Learning on Pacman:
Deep Q-Learning is a type of reinforcement learning algorithm that uses a neural network to approximate the Q-function, which represents the expected rewards for taking an action in a given state.
Deep Q-Learning has been applied to Pac-Man to create an AI agent that can learn to play the game at a high level.
The AI agent uses a neural network to approximate the Q-function and updates it based on the rewards it receives for each action taken.
The state of the game is represented as an image, and the neural network takes in this image as input and outputs the Q-values for each action.
The AI agent uses an epsilon-greedy policy to choose actions, with a high probability of choosing the action with the highest Q-value and a low probability of choosing a random action.
The AI agent can learn to play Pac-Man at a high level through trial and error, with the neural network updating its weights based on the rewards received.
Deep Q-Learning has been shown to be effective in playing Pac-Man, with AI agents trained using this method achieving high scores and outperforming human players.
Deep Q-Learning on Pac-Man has been used as a benchmark for testing different reinforcement learning algorithms and evaluating their performance.
Deep Q-Learning on Pac-Man is also used as an educational tool to teach students about reinforcement learning and neural networks.
Deep Q-Learning on Pac-Man is an example of how AI can be used to solve complex problems and play classic video games at a high level.
